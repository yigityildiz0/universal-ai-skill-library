- **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring completion status
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifying blockers and alternatives
- **Quality Gates**: Ensuring completion criteria are met

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze the Overall Task

Before breaking down work, understand the full scope:

**Discovery Questions**:
1. What is the end goal/deliverable?
2. What systems/components are affected?
3. What are the hard dependencies?
4. What can be parallelized?
5. What are the quality criteria?
6. What could block progress?

**Task Classification**:

| Type | Characteristics | Approach |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Feature** | New functionality | Design → Implement → Test → Document |
| **Refactor** | Restructuring | Analyze → Plan → Incremental changes → Verify |
| **Bug Fix** | Defect correction | Reproduce → Root cause → Fix → Regression test |
| **Migration** | System transition | Inventory → Plan → Execute → Validate → Cleanup |

### Step 2: Create Task Breakdown Structure

**Template for Task Decomposition**:

```markdown
## Task: [Main Task Name]

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Task 1.1: [Description]
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated effort: [S/M/L]
  - Files: [list affected files]

- [ ] Task 1.2: [Description]
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1
  - Estimated effort: [S/M/L]
  - Files: [list affected files]

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Task 2.1: [Description] (can run parallel with 2.2)
- [ ] Task 2.2: [Description] (can run parallel with 2.1)
- [ ] Task 2.3: [Description]
  - Dependencies: Tasks 2.1, 2.2

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Task 3.1: [Description]
- [ ] Task 3.2: [Description]

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] Task 4.1: [Description]
- [ ] Task 4.2: [Description]

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regressions
```

### Step 3: Identify Dependencies and Parallelization

**Dependency Types**:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Hard** | Must complete first | DB schema before queries |
| **Soft** | Preferred order | Tests before refactor |
| **Resource** | Shared resource | Same file modifications |
| **External** | Outside control | API availability |

**Dependency Graph Example**:

```
┌─────────┐
│ Task A  │ (Foundation)
└────┬────┘
     │
     ├─────────────────┐
     │                 │
┌────▼────┐      ┌────▼────┐
│ Task B  │      │ Task C  │  (Parallel)
└────┬────┘      └────┬────┘
     │                 │
     └────────┬────────┘
              │
         ┌────▼────┐
         │ Task D  │ (Depends on B and C)
         └────┬────┘
              │
         ┌────▼────┐
         │ Task E  │ (Final)
         └─────────┘
```

**Parallelization Opportunities**:

```markdown
## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Backend
- [ ] API endpoint implementation
- [ ] Database queries
- [ ] Business logic

### Stream B: Frontend (parallel with Stream A)
- [ ] UI components
- [ ] State management
- [ ] API integration (waits for Stream A)

### Stream C: Testing (parallel with A and B)
- [ ] Test scaffolding
- [ ] Mock data preparation
- [ ] Test implementation (waits for A and B)
```

### Step 4: Execute with Progress Tracking

**Progress Update Template**:

```markdown
## Progress Report: [Task Name]
**Status**: In Progress | Blocked | Complete
**Last Updated**: [Date/Time]

### Completed
- [x] Task 1.1: Foundation setup
- [x] Task 1.2: Database schema

### In Progress
- [ ] Task 2.1: API endpoints (70% complete)
  - Completed: GET, POST endpoints
  - Remaining: PUT, DELETE endpoints

### Blocked
- [ ] Task 2.3: Integration tests
  - Blocker: Waiting for Task 2.1 completion
  - Mitigation: Can prepare test scaffolding

### Not Started
- [ ] Task 3.1: Documentation
- [ ] Task 3.2: Cleanup

### Issues & Risks
1. [Issue description]
   - Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Mitigation: [Action]

### Next Steps
1. Complete Task 2.1 (API endpoints)
2. Unblock Task 2.3 (integration tests)
3. Begin Task 3.1 (documentation)
```

### Step 5: Handle Blockers and Adapt

**Blocker Resolution Framework**:

```markdown
## Blocker Analysis

### Blocker: [Description]

**Type**: Technical | External | Resource | Knowledge

**Impact Assessment**:
- Affected tasks: [List]
- Schedule impact: [Description]
- Risk level: High | Medium | Low

**Resolution Options**:

1. **Option A**: [Description]
   - Pros: [List]
   - Cons: [List]
   - Effort: [S/M/L]

2. **Option B**: [Description]
   - Pros: [List]
   - Cons: [List]

**Recommended**: Option [X] because [reasoning]

**Workaround** (if applicable):
- Temporary solution: [Description]

- **Clear dependencies** - Explicitly document what blocks what
- **Track actively** - Update progress frequently
- **Communicate blockers** - Surface issues early
- **Verify incrementally** - Test after each major task
- **Document decisions** - Record why choices were made
- **Plan for failure** - Have contingency approaches

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

When a task is too large or complex for a single agent context window, distribute work across multiple agents. The primary benefit of multi-agent systems is **context isolation**, not role specialization.

### Architectural Patterns

#### Pattern A: Supervisor/Orchestrator

A central agent decomposes tasks and routes them to specialized sub-agents.

```
                ┌──────────────┐
                │  Supervisor  │  (Decomposes, routes, aggregates)
                └──────┬───────┘
           ┌───────────┼───────────┐
     ┌─────▼─────┐ ┌───▼───┐ ┌────▼─────┐
     │  Agent A  │ │ Agent B│ │ Agent C  │
     │ (Research)│ │ (Code) │ │ (Review) │
     └───────────┘ └───────┘ └──────────┘
```

**When to use**: Tasks with clear decomposition, well-defined sub-task boundaries, and a need for centralized quality control.

**Trade-offs**: Strict control and consistent output; but the supervisor becomes a bottleneck and introduces the "telephone game problem" (summaries compound errors across handoffs).

#### Pattern B: Peer-to-Peer / Swarm

Agents communicate directly without a central controller.

**When to use**: Exploratory tasks, parallel research, tasks where each agent can independently contribute results that are later merged.

**Trade-offs**: No single point of failure and high parallelism; but coordination is complex, consensus is harder, and results may be inconsistent.

#### Pattern C: Hierarchical

Layered agents at different abstraction levels: strategy > planning > execution.

**When to use**: Large-scale implementations where high-level decisions guide mid-level planning, which in turn drives low-level execution. Each layer has its own context budget.

**Trade-offs**: Clean separation of concerns and scalable; but increased token cost and latency across layers.

### Token Economics of Multi-Agent Systems

| Configuration | Token Multiplier | When Justified |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Single-agent chat | 1x baseline | Simple tasks, short sessions |
| Single-agent + tools | 3-5x | Tasks requiring file reads, searches |
| Multi-agent (2-3 agents) | 5-10x | Tasks needing context isolation |
| Multi-agent (5+ agents) | 10-15x | Complex pipelines with specialized agents |

**Rule of thumb**: Only use multi-agent when the context isolation benefit outweighs the token cost. If a single agent can hold all relevant context, prefer that.

### Agent Handoff Protocol

When passing work between agents, use this structured handoff format:

```markdown
## Agent Handoff: [From Agent] → [To Agent]

### Task Summary
[One-sentence description of what the receiving agent should do]

### Context Provided
- Key findings: [Concise list]
- Files modified: [Paths]
- Decisions made: [With rationale]

### Constraints
- Must not modify: [Protected files/systems]
- Must follow: [Patterns, conventions]

### Expected Output
- Deliverable: [What the receiving agent should produce]
- Format: [How to structure the output]

### State
- Completed: [What is done]
- Remaining: [What is left]
```

**Critical guidelines**:
- Pass **structured state**, not raw conversation history
- Each agent should be able to operate with only the handoff document (no implicit context)
- Use file-based handoffs for large state (write findings to a shared file, reference the path)
- Set time-to-live limits to prevent infinite loops between agents

### Iterative Refinement Strategy
This skill is optimized for an iterative approach:
1. **Execute**: Perform the core steps defined above.
2. **Review**: Critically analyze the output (coverage, quality, completeness).
3. **Refine**: If targets aren't met, repeat the specific implementation steps with improved context.
4. **Loop**: Continue until the definition of done is satisfied.
