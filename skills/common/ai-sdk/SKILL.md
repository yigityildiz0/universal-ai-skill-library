## Prerequisites

Before searching docs, check if `node_modules/ai/docs/` exists. If it is absent, inspect the project package manager and state the exact dependency change. Install `ai` only when the user's request already authorizes dependency changes or after explicit confirmation.

Do not install other packages at this stage. Provider packages (e.g., `@ai-sdk/openai`) and client packages (e.g., `@ai-sdk/react`) should be installed later when needed based on user requirements.

## Critical: Do Not Trust Internal Knowledge

Everything you know about the AI SDK is outdated or wrong. Your training data contains obsolete APIs, deprecated patterns, and incorrect usage.

**When working with the AI SDK:**

1. Inspect the installed `ai` version and local docs first; add the package only under the prerequisite rule above
2. Search `node_modules/ai/docs/` and `node_modules/ai/src/` for current APIs
3. If not found locally, search ai-sdk.dev documentation (instructions below)
4. Never rely on memory - always verify against source code or docs
5. **`useChat` has changed significantly** - check [Common Errors](references/common-errors.md) before writing client code
6. Preserve the provider already used by the project. If none is configured, ask for requirements or present provider-neutral options; do not default to a gateway or vendor. Use [AI Gateway Reference](references/ai-gateway.md) only when the project or user chooses Vercel AI Gateway.
7. **Verify model IDs at implementation time.** Read the installed provider package docs, the configured provider catalog, or current official provider documentation. Never infer freshness from a larger-looking version number and never change providers merely to obtain a newer model.
8. Run typecheck after changes to ensure code is correct
9. **Be minimal** - Only specify options that differ from defaults. When unsure of defaults, check docs or source rather than guessing or over-specifying.

If you cannot find documentation to support your answer, state that explicitly.

## Finding Documentation

### Installed package

Search bundled docs and source in `node_modules/ai/`:

- **Docs**: `grep "query" node_modules/ai/docs/`
- **Source**: `grep "query" node_modules/ai/src/`

Provider packages include docs at `node_modules/@ai-sdk/<provider>/docs/`.

### When local documentation is unavailable

1. Search: `https://ai-sdk.dev/api/search-docs?q=your_query`
2. Fetch `.md` URLs from results (e.g., `https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/agents/building-agents.md`)

## When Typecheck Fails

**Before searching source code**, grep [Common Errors](references/common-errors.md) for the failing property or function name. Many type errors are caused by deprecated APIs documented there.

If not found in common-errors.md:

1. Search `node_modules/ai/src/` and `node_modules/ai/docs/`
2. Search ai-sdk.dev (for earlier versions or if not found locally)

## Building and Consuming Agents

### Creating Agents

Use the agent API documented by the installed package. Use `ToolLoopAgent` only when that symbol exists in the installed version and matches the task; otherwise follow the current documented agent or `generateText`/`streamText` pattern.

**File conventions**: See [type-safe-agents.md](references/type-safe-agents.md) for where to save agents and tools.

**Type Safety**: When consuming agents with `useChat`, always use `InferAgentUIMessage<typeof agent>` for type-safe tool results. See [reference](references/type-safe-agents.md).

### Consuming Agents (Framework-Specific)

Before implementing agent consumption:

1. Check `package.json` to detect the project's framework/stack
2. Search documentation for the framework's quickstart guide
3. Follow the framework-specific patterns for streaming, API routes, and client integration
