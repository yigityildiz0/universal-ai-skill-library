# 🪢 Agentspace

**See what your agent is doing — from anywhere.**

Your agent keeps writing — logs, code, generated outputs. You open a URL and watch the folder evolve in the browser. No sync, no zip, no account.

1. Tell the agent to share any local folder or file.
2. The agent returns a URL — anyone opens it in the browser, no signup.

[agentspace.so](https://agentspace.so/?utm_source=skills.sh&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=agentspace) · [GitHub](https://github.com/agentspace-so/skills) · [npm @agentspace-so/ascli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentspace-so/ascli)

## What you can share

Folders, single files, generated code, test output, build logs, screenshots, PDFs, reports, dashboards, prototypes — any local artifact.

## How it works

- One command (`ascli share <path>`) creates an anonymous workspace and returns a link.
- Anyone opens the link — reads, comments, or edits directly in the browser.
- Anonymous workspaces live 24 hours. One email claim makes them permanent.
- Hosted on Cloudflare's edge network — links load fast worldwide.

## Data handling

- Only the path the user explicitly names is uploaded. Do not default to the current working directory unless the user clearly says so.
- All network traffic goes to `agentspace.so` only.
- The skill does not read environment variables, shell history, or files outside the path the user specifies.

## Choose the CLI path

1. If `ascli` is already on `PATH`, use it directly.
2. Else if `npm` is available, install once with `npm install -g @agentspace-so/ascli@latest`, or run without installing via `npx @agentspace-so/ascli@latest <command>`.
3. If neither `ascli` nor `npm` is available, stop and tell the user to install Node.js from nodejs.org first.

Do not pipe a remote script into a shell to install.

## Share a path

- Ask the user which folder or file to share if they have not named one explicitly. Do not assume `.`.
- Run `ascli share <path> --permission edit` with the user-specified path.
- If the user asks for view-only access, use `--permission view`.
- `share` handles an unbound folder by creating a temporary workspace, syncing once, and returning a link — no separate `sync` step is needed.
- Return the share URL directly to the user exactly as the CLI prints it.

## Guardrails

- Do not invent claim URLs, workspace URLs, or share URLs. Only return what the CLI prints.
- Do not require a global install if `npx` already works.
- Do not move the user into a different project just to use agentspace.so.
- If the user asks to "share this folder" and the target is ambiguous, confirm the exact path before running.
- If you need exact command variants, read [references/commands.md](references/commands.md).
