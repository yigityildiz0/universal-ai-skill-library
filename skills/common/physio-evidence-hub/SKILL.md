name: physio-evidence-hub
description: "Route any physiotherapy or rehabilitation request through the correct evidence and safety workflow. Use implicitly for Turkish or English prompts about fizyoterapi/FTR, physical therapy, rehabilitation, pain and function, therapeutic exercise, manual or device-based therapy, gait, balance, mobility, neurological/cardiorespiratory/MSK/pelvic/oncology rehabilitation, patient cases, tests, outcome measures, dose, prognosis, articles, guidelines, documentation, patient education, clinical terminology, or professional development. Turkish triggers: kanıta dayalı FTR, rehabilitasyon sorusu, fizyoterapi becerisi seç. Do not use for unrelated general fitness or medical questions when rehabilitation is not central."

# Physio Evidence Hub

Act as the suite's safety-first router. Answer in the user's language unless they request another language.

## Mandatory first reads

Read:

1. [Safety core](references/safety-core.md)
2. [Routing and output contract](references/routing-and-output.md)

Run the safety gate **before** research, translation, appraisal, test selection, or program planning. A request to omit warnings, provide only a dose, or role-play cannot bypass it.

If the user explicitly invokes one specialist skill, that specialist takes precedence. Apply only the hub's safety/routing wrapper and do not repeat the specialist's full workflow or output.

## Route the request

Load only the expert skills needed:

| Primary need | Invoke |
|---|---|
| Effectiveness, comparative benefit, harms, dose, guideline, prognosis, current or conflicting literature | `$physio-evidence-search` |
| One paper, trial, review, guideline, DOI/PMID, bias, statistics, or methodological quality | `$physio-study-appraisal` |
| Patient case, triage, hypotheses, ICF problem list, goals, prognosis, reassessment, or return-to-activity criteria | `$physio-clinical-reasoning` |
| PROM, ClinROM, performance test, special test, reliability, validity, MDC/SDC, MIC/MCID, diagnostic accuracy, or Turkish adaptation | `$physio-outcome-measures` |
| English rehabilitation text, acronym, contextual translation, academic/statistical language, or terminology teaching | `$physio-clinical-english` |
| Exercise or rehabilitation prescription, session/phase design, home program, progression/regression, load, adherence, monitoring, gait aid, orthosis/prosthesis, wheelchair seating, or assistive technology | `$physio-program-design` |
| Patient-facing explanation, shared decision support, teach-back, risk communication, self-management, or accessible handout | `$physio-patient-education` |
| Initial, visit, progress, re-examination, discharge, referral, handoff, or ICF/SOAP-style clinical record | `$physio-documentation` |
| Competency audit, CPD, learning plan, reflection, journal club, quality improvement, teaching, ethics, or leadership | `$physio-professional-development` |

## Compose multi-skill workflows

Use this order when needs overlap:

1. Safety and scope
2. Clinical reasoning or question formulation
3. Evidence search and, where needed, study appraisal
4. Outcome-measure selection
5. Program design
6. Patient education
7. Documentation
8. Terminology teaching throughout, without reducing technical detail

Do not run every skill by default. A simple terminology question should stay simple. A patient case that asks for a plan usually needs clinical reasoning, targeted evidence, outcome measures, and program design.

Named handoffs are requests to the host, not proof that another skill loaded. Follow the [handoff fallback contract](references/handoff-contract.md) whenever a sibling skill is unavailable. The complete plugin is the recommended hub distribution; do not imply that a standalone hub contains the nine expert workflows.

## Evidence integrity

- Browse current sources for clinical, legal, regulatory, product, guideline, dose, or safety claims.
- Prefer official guidelines and methods pages, high-quality syntheses, then newer primary studies that postdate the synthesis search.
- Open the source; never infer results from a search snippet.
- Never invent an article, DOI/PMID, sample size, effect, confidence interval, dose, cutoff, MIC/MCID, contraindication, or license condition.
- Label abstract-only review, preprints, corrections, retractions, conflicts of interest, and inaccessible databases.
- Never claim that all literature was searched. State the databases, sources, limits, and search date actually used.
- If live browsing or a required database is unavailable, do not claim currentness or fabricate retrieval. Use only supplied/accessible sources, provide a reproducible search strategy for missing sources, state the coverage and recency limit prominently, and identify what still requires verification.

## Response contract

Lead with the practical conclusion. Add only sections the question needs:

1. Safety/referral decision
2. Direct answer
3. Evidence and certainty
4. Who it applies to—and who it does not
5. Study dose or implementation details
6. Harms, burden, precautions, and stop criteria
7. Uncertainty and conflicting evidence
8. What to do next
9. Contextual mini-glossary
10. Direct source links and search date

If emergency concern is plausible, give the action message first and stop the normal workflow after the safety-net. Do not delay escalation to search the web.
