## Instructions

### Step 1: Dependency Vulnerability Scan

```bash
# Python
pip-audit
safety check

# JavaScript
npm audit
snyk test

# Java
mvn dependency-check:check
```

### Step 2: Static Security Analysis

```bash
# Python
bandit -r src/

# JavaScript
npm audit
eslint --plugin security src/

# Java
spotbugs with find-sec-bugs
```

### Step 3: 10-Domain Security Scan

Reference: `references/security-checklist.md`

Work through each domain systematically, applying its diagnostic question:

#### Domain 1: Input/Output Safety
**Diagnostic**: "Does any user-controlled input reach a sensitive sink without sanitization?"
- XSS (innerHTML, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, unescaped template output)
- SQL/NoSQL/Command/GraphQL injection
- SSRF (user-controlled URLs in server requests)
- Path traversal (../ in file paths)
- Prototype pollution (deep merge of user objects)

#### Domain 2: Authentication & Authorization
**Diagnostic**: "Can an authenticated user access resources belonging to another user or tenant?"
- Missing auth guards on endpoints
- Missing tenant checks in multi-tenant systems
- IDOR (direct object references without ownership check)
- Privilege escalation via client-provided roles
- Session fixation (session ID not rotated after login)

#### Domain 3: JWT & Token Security
**Diagnostic**: "What happens if an attacker captures a valid token? How long can they use it?"
- Algorithm confusion (accepting `none` or wrong algorithm)
- Hardcoded signing secrets
- Missing expiration validation
- Sensitive data in JWT payload
- Missing issuer/audience validation

#### Domain 4: Secrets and PII
**Diagnostic**: "If I grep for common secret patterns, what do I find?"
- API keys, credentials in source code
- Secrets in git history
- PII in logs without masking
- Secrets in error messages
- Unencrypted password storage

#### Domain 5: Supply Chain & Dependencies
**Diagnostic**: "If a dependency is compromised, what is the blast radius?"
- Unpinned dependencies (version ranges)
- Dependency confusion risks
- External scripts without SRI integrity
- Known CVEs in dependencies
- Abandoned packages (no maintenance 12+ months)

#### Domain 6: CORS & Security Headers
**Diagnostic**: "What security headers are set? Which are missing?"
- Permissive CORS on authenticated endpoints
- Missing CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- Missing HSTS
- Exposed internal headers (server version, debug info)

#### Domain 7: Runtime Risks
**Diagnostic**: "Can an attacker cause this service to become unresponsive with a single crafted request?"
- Unbounded loops controlled by user input
- Missing timeouts on external calls
- Missing rate limiting on public endpoints
- Sync I/O in async context
- ReDoS (catastrophic regex backtracking)

#### Domain 8: Cryptography
**Diagnostic**: "Are we using well-vetted cryptographic libraries with secure defaults?"
- Weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1 for security)
- Hardcoded IVs/salts
- Encryption without authentication (AES-CBC without HMAC)
- Insufficient key length
- Custom crypto implementations
- Insecure random (Math.random, random.random for security)

#### Domain 9: Race Conditions (Deep Dive)
**Diagnostic questions**:
1. "Is any shared state accessed by multiple threads/processes/requests without synchronization?"
2. "Are there check-then-act patterns where check and action are not atomic?"
3. "Do database operations that read and write the same row use appropriate isolation?"
4. "In distributed components, what happens if the same event is processed twice?"

Sub-categories:
- **9a: Shared State**: Unsynchronized concurrent access, non-thread-safe collections, global mutable state
- **9b: Check-Then-Act (TOCTOU)**: if-exists-then-use, balance-check-then-deduct, permission check separate from action
- **9c: Database Concurrency**: Missing locking, non-atomic counters, read-modify-write without isolation
- **9d: Distributed Systems**: Missing distributed locks, cache invalidation races, event ordering, split-brain

#### Domain 10: Data Integrity
**Diagnostic**: "If this operation fails halfway through, what state is the data left in?"
- Missing transactions for multi-step operations
- Weak validation before persistence
- Missing idempotency on retry-able paths
- Lost updates from concurrent writes
- Cascade failures from unguarded deletes

### Step 4: Document Findings

For each finding, document both **exploitability** (how easy to exploit) and **impact** (what damage results).

```markdown
## Security Finding

**Vulnerability**: [Type]
**File**: [path/to/file.py:42]
**Severity**: P0 (CRITICAL)
**Domain**: [1-10]
**OWASP**: [A01-A10 if applicable]
**CVE**: [If applicable]

### Description
[Detailed description]

### Exploitability
[How easy to exploit: trivial / moderate / complex]

### Impact
[What damage results: data breach / service disruption / data corruption]

### Vulnerable Code

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan completed
- [ ] Static security analysis run
- [ ] All 10 security domains checked with diagnostic questions
- [ ] Race conditions analyzed (all 4 sub-categories)
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 mapped
- [ ] Exploitability and impact documented for each finding
- [ ] Language-specific vulnerabilities checked
- [ ] Findings documented with severity (P0-P3)

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We have no sensitive data, so security doesn't apply" | Injection flaws and SSRF can compromise the underlying server even when the application itself holds no sensitive data, giving attackers a foothold into the broader network. |
| "The framework handles security for us" | Frameworks prevent common pitfalls but cannot prevent IDOR — a developer must still verify ownership before returning a record. Dozens of real-world breaches (e.g., Optus 2022) happened despite using secure frameworks. |
| "We'll add security later before launch" | Security findings discovered post-architecture (e.g., algorithm confusion in JWT, hardcoded secrets) require far more rework than findings caught during initial development. |
| "Our internal API isn't internet-facing so OWASP doesn't apply" | Insider threats and supply chain compromises mean internal APIs are regularly attacked; the Capital One breach in 2019 originated from an internal SSRF call. |
| "We passed a pentest last quarter, so we're fine" | A pentest is a point-in-time snapshot; new code paths, dependency CVEs, and configuration changes introduced after the test are not covered. |
| "Race conditions only matter at scale" | Check-Then-Act race conditions in balance deduction logic have been exploited at low request volumes via simple two-tab browser attacks, enabling duplicate payments and negative balances. |

## Verification

### Iterative Refinement Strategy
This skill is optimized for an iterative approach:
1. **Execute**: Perform the core steps defined above.
2. **Review**: Critically analyze the output (coverage, quality, completeness).
3. **Refine**: If targets aren't met, repeat the specific implementation steps with improved context.
4. **Loop**: Continue until the definition of done is satisfied.
